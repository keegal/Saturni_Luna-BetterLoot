WHAT IS THIS MOD?

- Temporary improvement to the dynamic loot pools in JET for each map which includes standard loose loot locations and marked rooms.
I strongly feel this will become obsolete as AE is improved over time, but for now this is what I've come up with to increase the loot
in all maps while keeping it balanced for one individual. Hopefully there is a healthy balance of fun and grind with it without relying too much
on container RNG.

HOW WILL MY EXPERIENCE CHANGE?
- Right now marked rooms are usually empty and  usual loot locations like med in reserve have thin pickings. You should
universally see an increase amount of loose loot around the maps and actually have loot within marked rooms.

HOW?

- Right now we are making a pass X amount of times to generate a random set of loot in range of [0, X]. We
are utilizing spawn chances for every item and also counting failures as a pass, 
so the realistic output for a map like reserve is not much more than a few hundred items. This mod
changes it so failed passes do not lower the maximum possible loot count.


I HAVE AN IDEA FOR THIS MOD, HAVE FEEDBACK, OR NEED HELP

- Would love to hear your experiences while using this, I'm very open to modifying these values over time.
- Direct message Saturni Luna in the AE discord.

BEFORE YOU ASK
- Can you increase loot for a specific location?
    - No, I cannot increase loot for specific areas right now
- Can you add or remove a specific item from the loot pool?
    - Out of scope for what this mod wants to accomplish
- I opened a marked room and there was nothing in there!
    - Like live, there are chances you will not get anything. On average you should see 1-2 items. I haven't
      changed rarities! :)
